        <h1>Set up</h1><br />
        <p>Simply open the file named "boxbox" and drag all the content inside to your server file manager (the same place you should have your other content). It will usually be in a file called "public_html" but it might not be so... After that it should be done and ready to use if its in the right place and other files arent interfeering, if your chatpoints webpage isnt in its own file then put it in one so it doesnt interfere with the index.php</p><br /><br />
        <h1>Analytics</h1>
        <p>Setting up your analytics is easy, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> and set up your site there, after you have done that follow the steps below.<br />

        <br /><br /><h1>Help</h1><br /><p>I ask that you add me to your google analytics panel, just click admin, then user management and add this email: "rh0381@gmail.com" and please notify me by email, if you need help installing just email me with that same email and I will help you, heck I will even install it for you if you allow me to. If something is broken, again, email me and I will fix it. For me to install and fix things without you needing to be there you will need to give me access to your server control panel.</p>
